# Runs after the build step (always, even on failure).
#
# - Candidate succeeded  -> promote it: manifest's "good" becomes this SHA.
# - Candidate failed     -> blacklist it: append to "bad", "good" untouched
#                           (this IS the rollback — nothing else changes).
# - No candidate was used this run -> nothing to do.
#
# Matrix jobs (RESUKISU / SUKISU) run in parallel and may both try to
# write manifest.json at the same time, so every write goes through a
# fetch-rebase-push retry loop instead of a single commit+push.
#
# Args: <build outcome: "success" | "failure"> <space-separated component keys to check, e.g. "resukisu susfs">
